Project Description

This project is a comprehensive User Authentication and Cart Management System designed as part of a larger Learning Management System (LMS). The frontend is built using React.js, Redux, and Tailwind CSS, providing a responsive and dynamic user experience. The backend is powered by Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Mongoose to manage users, authentication tokens, and cart functionalities. Users can register, log in, and manage their course selections through a cart interface.
